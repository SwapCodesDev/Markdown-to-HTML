Here's an explanation of basic `Python` code concepts:

### 1. *Variables and Data Types:*
In Python, you can store values in variables. These variables can hold different types of data like integers, strings, floats, etc.

```python
# Defining variables
name = "<John>"  # String
age = 25       # Integer
height = 5.9    # Float
is_student = True  # Boolean
```

### 2. **Print Statement:**
You can print output using the `print()` function.

```python
print("Hello, World!")  # Output: Hello, World!
```

### 3. **Comments:**
Comments are used to explain the code and are ignored by the interpreter. They start with a `#`.

```python
# This is a comment
```

### 4. **Conditionals (if, elif, else):**
You can make decisions in your code using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

```python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

### 5. **Loops:**
- **For loop**: Iterate over a sequence (like a list or range).

```python
for i in range(5):  # Loop from 0 to 4
    print(i)
```

- **While loop**: Repeats as long as a condition is true.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Increment count
```

### 6. **Functions:**
A function is a block of code that can be called to perform a task.

```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice
```

### 7. **Lists:**
A list is an ordered collection of items.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
```

### 8. **Dictionaries:**
A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs.

```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(person["name"])  # Output: John
```

### 9. **Importing Libraries:**
You can use libraries to extend Python's functionality.

```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
```

These are just the basics, but Python is a versatile language with a lot of depth!
